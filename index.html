<h1>Instructions to Hang Trump flag - Flagwix</h1>

<div class="container">

<p>Hanging <a href="https://flagwix.com/collections/trump-flag/">Trump flag</a> is exceptionally simple.</p>

<ul>
    <li>First you must have something to show it on like a post, stand or section. To show on a post, first pick your area to show your flag.</li>
    <li>On the off chance that during establishment you find the ground excessively hard, you can douse it with a can of water or splash with a garden hose. Position your post straight on a level plane and in an upward direction.</li>
    <li>Straight push down on the H stake with the underside of your foot (shoe on obviously!) somewhat way to make sure it's remaining all alone. Step back and check whether it gazes directly from the front and side point.</li>
    <li>Change on a case by case basis. At the point when it suits you, push the shaft as far as possible level to the ground.</li>
    <li>Presently it is the right time to put the flag on. Along the highest point of the flag there is an initial that runs the length of the flag with 2 open closures. Open one end and slide it on the level bar until it's totally on and hanging.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few flags are uneven so you'll need to accurately ensure it's on the shaft. I'm alluding to uneven flags that have text on them as it were. You don't need the text perusing in reverse. Since flag sleeves and flagpole bars at some point come in various sizes, you'll either need to put the flag on in reverse to make it read accurately when it hangs or you perhaps ready to put it on accurately in the first place.</p>

<p>At any rate, in the event that the flag text doesn't peruse accurately, pull the flag off and turn over and slide on. It will be right then, at that point. In the event that you have a plug, push this on the bar too after the flag.</p>

<p>Another thought is have a sunlight based light gleaming on your flag. Place the sun based light in the ground before the flag. Your light should be in daylight basically for a day for it to charge. It should stay in daylight to daily enlighten. It won't sparkle as lengthy during the evening on the off chance that the day has been shady.</p>
